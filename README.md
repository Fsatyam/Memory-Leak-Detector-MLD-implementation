# Memory-Leak-Detector-MLD-implementation
This is a C Project in which I have write a library that catches the memory leaks, if any, by the application. 
In this project, I have implemented a garbage collector library called MLD (Memory Leak Detector) which when 
integrated to your application will provide the facility to catch leaked objects and report them. 
MLD library will be the generic library and has the ability to parse any application's data structures and manipulate them.
